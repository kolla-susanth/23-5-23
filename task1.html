            <h1>Playing style</h1><hr>
            <p id="Playingstyle">Raina is an attacking middle order left handed batter. He had more success in limited over cricket than in test. He has weakness of short pitched balls and throughout his career opposition teams tried to exploit this weakness. Also in Ranji trophy he has struggled against short balls. He has been widely criticised for his short ball weakness. He is part time off break bowler. His favourite scoring area is mid wickets on side. Most of the times he plays inside out off drive shot. While trying to hit on off side, he creates room for himself.<br><br></p>
